    "# Command Designe Pattern\n",

    "This example illustrates the structure of the **Command** design pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What classes does it consist of?\n",
    "- What roles do these classes play?\n",
    "- In what way the elements of the pattern are related?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage examples:** The Command pattern is pretty common in Python code. Most often it’s used as an alternative for callbacks to parameterizing UI elements with actions. It’s also used for queueing tasks, tracking operations history, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identification:** The Command pattern is recognizable by behavioral methods in an abstract/interface type (sender) which invokes a method in an implementation of a different abstract/interface type (receiver) which has been encapsulated by the command implementation during its creation. Command classes are usually limited to specific actions."
