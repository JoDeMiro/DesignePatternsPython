    "This example illustrates the structure of the **Chain of Responsibility** design pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What classes does it consist of?\n",
    "- What roles do these classes play?\n",
    "- In what way the elements of the pattern are related?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage examples:** The Chain of Responsibility is pretty common in Python. Itâ€™s mostly relevant when your code operates with chains of objects, such as filters, event chains, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identification:** The pattern is recognizable by behavioral methods of one group of objects that indirectly call the same methods in other objects, while all the objects follow the common interface.\n"
