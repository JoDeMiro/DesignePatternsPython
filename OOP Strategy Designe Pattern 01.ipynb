    "# Strategy Designe Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the strategy design pattern, let's take an example of a transport system. You are developing an application, which provides the time estimation for user-selected routes. There are different kinds of transports available like public transport, car, and bike. Each mood of transport has different estimation times based on their speed and other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple approach to solve it is using the if…else conditions. Each transport mood will be available in a different ‘if ’block of code. This approach will lead to problems while maintaining the code in the long run. Each time we need to add new functionality, code modification will be required. The better approach to implement it is by using the strategy design pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of strategy pattern, we will define the family of algorithms as Car, Public Transport, Bike and encapsulated it using the Transport interface. A user can use these algorithms independently to estimate travel time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy pattern lets you change the behavior at runtime by using composition.**\n",
